## How to get GitHub Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens
2. Generate new token (classic)
3. Select the following scopes:
   - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - `public_repo` (Access public repositories)
4. Copy the token and add it to Vercel environment variables

## Vercel Deployment

The app will automatically use GitHub as a database, reading from and writing to the `public/blogs.json` file in your repository.
